# üåä Flood Rapid Mapping using Satellite Data

This project focuses on **rapid segmentation of water bodies** using harmonized Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellite imagery. The solution is essential for applications such as **flood monitoring, water resource management, and environmental conservation**. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model accurately segments water areas in near real-time and is deployed via a Flask web interface.

### Stage 2: U-Net with Pretrained ResNet-18 Encoder

* Enhanced the architecture by integrating a **pretrained ResNet-18** encoder.
* To match the expected 3-channel input shape of ResNet-18 (**128√ó128√ó3**), the **NIR, SWIR1, and Green** bands were selected.
* **Band Selection Justification**: These bands are commonly used in computing the **Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)**, which is effective for detecting water bodies, enhancing model sensitivity to flooded regions.
* Loss Function: **Dice Loss**
* Benefit: Transfer learning improved feature extraction and generalization from satellite imagery.
* Final Evaluation on test set:

  * **IoU**: 0.78
  * **Dice Coefficient**: **0.85**
